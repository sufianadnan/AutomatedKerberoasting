## Overview

I created this project as part of my final assignment during my first year in college. The assignment required us to demonstrate our understanding of 2 or 3 cyber attacks we had learned in class. In response, I developed an automated script that can execute multiple types of cyber attacks. I went above and beyond to create a comprehensive tool and received a perfect grade in a challenging course. I created this script after learning python for a few months, it is really rough and it will be updated soon to be more efficent and more trustworthy for social engineering attacks.

### Attacks Included

The script includes the following cyber attacks:

1. **Kerberoasting**: This attack focuses on extracting service account credentials from Active Directory, specifically targeting accounts that may have weak passwords. The script automates the process of identifying vulnerable accounts and can request Kerberos tickets for these accounts.

2. **System Infomation**: It captures all system information such as OS, Mac Address and Windows Key.

3. **Silver Ticket Attack**




#### Description

These scripts are related to Kerberoasting, a technique used to extract service account credentials from Active Directory.

#### Usage
There is a prepacked EXE, this won't work anymore as the discord webhook is no longer valid, so edit the pastebin link in `main.py`.
